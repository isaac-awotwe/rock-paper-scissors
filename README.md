# The Rock Paper Scissors Game

The game starts out asking the user or player to choose between Rock, paper and scissors.
The "computer" also makes a choice between the three items using randomization.
Once the user make sa choice, they would see a photo of their choice and also a photo of the computer's randomized choice.

The result of the game (win, lose, or draw) is determined by a comparison between the user's choice and the computer's randomized choice.
We get the "computer" to play this game with us by using Python randomization.


The rules of the game which can be found on the [World Rock Paper Scissors Association website](https://wrpsa.com/), and summarizes as follow:
1. If both the user and the computer choose the same item, it's a draw game.
2. The rock beats scissors (by crushing the scissors).
3. Paper beats rock by covering the rock.
4. Scissors beats paper by cutting the paper.
